## Overview
During this lab, I completed work with Oracle’s Multitenant Architecture, which enables multiple pluggable databases (PDBs) to exist within a single container database (CDB).
The goal was to create, manage, and delete PDBs in addition to setting up and accessing Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) to monitor the PDBs.

Through this hands-on experience, I better learned how PDBs work, how to manage database containers using SQL commands, and how to use OEM for administration and monitoring.
## Task 1 — Creating a New Pluggable Database (PDB)

### Objective
To create a new PDB using the required naming convention and assign an admin user who will store all classwork.
